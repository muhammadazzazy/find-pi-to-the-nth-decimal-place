# Find Pi to the Nth Decimal Place
This is a Python implementation for a program that takes the number of decimal places from the user as input (where the number of decimal places should not exceed 15) and outputs the value of pi (Ï€) up to the number of decimal places provided. The number of decimal places can either be entered in numerals or words. User input is validated, which avoids Python's `ValueError` no matter what is supplied as input.

This program requires Python 3 which can be installed from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

First, a virtual environment can be created and activated using the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Then, the required Python packages need to be installed which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file using the command below:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start the program, run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
