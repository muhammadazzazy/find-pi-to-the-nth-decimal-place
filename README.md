# Find Pi to the Nth Decimal Place
This is a Python implementation for a program that takes the number of decimal places from the user as input (where the number of decimal places should not exceed 15) and prints the value of pi up to the number of decimal places provided.
To start the  program, simply run the command below in a shell:
`python3 main.py`
The project idea was obtained from this [repo](https://github.com/karan/Projects).
