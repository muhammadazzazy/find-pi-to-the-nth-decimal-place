# Find Pi to the Nth Decimal Place
This is a Python implementation for a program that takes the number of decimal places from the user as input (where the number of decimal places should not exceed 15) and outputs the value of pi up to the number of decimal places provided. User input is validated, which avoids Python's `ValueError` no matter what the user provides.

To start the  program, run the command below in a shell:

`python3 main.py`

The project idea was obtained from this [repo](https://github.com/karan/Projects).
