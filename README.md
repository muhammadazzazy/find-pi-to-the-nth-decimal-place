# Find Pi to the Nth Decimal Place
This is a Python implementation for a program that takes the number of decimal places from the user as input (where the number of decimal places should not exceed 15) and outputs the value of pi up to the number of decimal places provided. User input is validated, which avoids Python's `ValueError` no matter what the user provides.

This program requires Python 3 which can be installed from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To start the program, run the command below in a shell:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
The project idea was obtained from [karan/Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects#numbers).
